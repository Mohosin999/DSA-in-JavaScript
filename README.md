# Data Structures & Algorithms in JavaScript

### What is Data Structure:

A data structure is a specific way of organizing, storing and accessing
data.

### What is an Algorithm:

A set of instructions that tells a computer how to do something, or you
can also say step by step solution of the problem is called algorithm.

### How can we tell if the code we just wrote is good code?

- The answer is `Big O` notation

### Big O

Big O notation helps us understand `how long` an algorithm will take to run _(time complexity)_ or `how much` memory it will need as the amount of data it handles grows _(space complexity)_.

#### O(n)

Signifies that the execution time of algorithm grows `linearly` in proportion to the size of the `input data` (n).
